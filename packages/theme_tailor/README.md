# Motivation
Flutter 3.0 provides a new way of theming applications via ThemeData's theme extensions.
To declare theme extension, we need to:
- define a class that extends ThemeData,
- define a constructor and fields,
- implement "copyWith",
- implement "lerp",
- (optionally) override "hashCode",
- (optionally) override "==" operator
- (optionally) implement "debugFillProperties" method
- (optionally) add serialization code

In addition to generating themes, we may want to declare utility extensions to access theme properties via an extension on BuildContext or ThemeData that requires additional work.
Implementing this requires lots of additional lines of code and time.

# How to use
## Install
ThemeTailor is a code generator and requires [build_runner] to run.
Make sure to add these packages to the project dependencies:
- [build_runner] tool to run code generators (dev dependency)
- [theme_tailor] this package - theming utility (dev dependency)
- [theme_tailor_annotation] annotations for [theme_tailor]


```console
flutter pub add --dev build_runner
flutter pub add --dev theme_tailor
flutter pub add theme_tailor_annotation
```

## Add imports and part directive
ThemeTailor is a generator for annotation that generates code in a part file that needs to be specified. Make sure to add the following imports and part directive in the file where you use the annotation.

Make sure to specify the correct file name in a part directive. In the example below, replace "name" with the file name.

###### name.dart
```dart
import 'package:theme_tailor_annotation/theme_tailor_annotation.dart';

part 'name.tailor.dart';
```

## Run the code generator
To run the code generator, run the following commands:

```console
flutter run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Create Theme class
ThemeTailor will generate ThemeExtension class based on the configuration class you are required to annotate with [theme_tailor_annotation]. Please make sure to name class and theme properties appropriately according to the following rules:
- class name starts with `_$` or `$_` (Recommendation is to use the former, as it ensures that the configuration class is private). If the class name does not contain the required prefix, then the generated class name will append an additional suffix,
- class contains static `List<T>` fields (e.g. `static List<Color> surface = []`). If no fields exist in the config class, the generator will create an empty ThemeExtension class.

Example
###### my_theme.dart
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:theme_tailor_annotation/theme_tailor_annotation.dart';

part 'my_theme.tailor.dart';

@tailor
class _$MyTheme {
  static List<Color> background = [Colors.white, Colors.black];
}
```

The following code snippet defines the "MyTheme" theme extension class.
- "MyTheme" extends `ThemeExtension<MyTheme>`
- defined class is immutable with final fields with const constructor
- there is one field "background" of type Color
- "light" and  "dark" static fields matching the default theme names supplied by [theme_tailor_annotation]
- "copyWith" method is created (override of ThemeExtension) with a nullable argument "background" of type "Color"
- "lerp" method is created (override of ThemeExtension) with the default lerping method for the "Color" type.
- "hashCode" method && "==" operator are created

Additionally [theme_tailor_annotation] by default generates extension on BuildContext
- "MyThemeBuildContextProps" extension on "BuildContext" is generated
- getter on "background" of type "Color" is added directly to "BuildContext"

## Change themes' quantity and names
By default,  "@tailor" will generate two themes: "light" and "dark";
To control the names and quantity of the themes, edit the "themes" property on the "@Tailor" annotation.\
You can also change theme names globally by adjusting `build.yaml`. Check out [Build configuration](#build-configuration) for more info

```dart
@Tailor(themes: ['baseTheme'])
class _$MyTheme {}
```

## Access generated themes list
The generator will create a static getter with a list of the generated themes:

``` dart
final allThemes = MyTailorGeneratedTheme.themes;
```

If the `themes` property is already used in the Tailor class, the generator will use another name and print a warning.

## Change generated extensions
By default, "@tailor" will generate an extension on "BuildContext" and expand theme properties as getters. If this is an undesired behavior, you can disable it by changing the "themeGetter" property in the "@Tailor" or using the "@TailorComponent" annotation.

```dart
@Tailor(themeGetter: ThemeGetter.none)
// OR
@TailorComponent()
```

"ThemeGetter" has several variants for generating common extensions to ease access to the declared themes.

## Nesting generated ThemeExtensions, Modular themes && DesignSystems
It might be beneficial to split them into smaller parts, where each part is responsible for the theme of one component. You can think about it as modularization of the theme. ThemeExtensions allow easier custom theme integration with Flutter ThemeData without creating additional Inherited widgets handling theme changes. It is especially beneficial when 
- Creating design systems,
- Modularization of the application per feature and components,
- Create a package that supplies widgets and needs more or additional properties not found in ThemeData.

###### Structure of the application's theme data and its extensions. "chatComponentsTheme" has nested properties.
```yaml
ThemeData: [] # Flutter's material widgets props
ThemeDataExtensions:
  - ChatComponentsTheme: 
    - MsgBubble: 
      - Bubble: myBubble
      - Bubble: friendsBubble
    - MsgList: [foo, bar, baz]
```

Use "@tailor" and "@Tailor" annotations if you may need additional extensions on ThemeData or ThemeContext.

Use "@tailorComponent" or "@TailorComponent" if you intend to nest the theme extension class and do not need additional extensions. Use this annotation for generated themes to allow the generator to recognize the type correctly. 

```dart
/// Use generated "ChatComponentsTheme" in ThemeData
@tailor
class _$ChatComponentsTheme {
  @themeExtension
  static List<MsgBubble> msgBubble = MsgBubble.themes;

  @themeExtension
  static List<MsgList> msgList = MsgList.themes;

  /// "NotGeneratedExtension" is a theme extension that is not created using the code generator. It is not necessary to mark it with "@themeExtension" annotation
  static List<NotGeneratedExtension> notGeneratedExtension = [/*custom themes*/];
}

@tailorComponent
class _$MsgBubble {
  // Keep in mind that Bubble type used here may be another Tailor component, and its generated themes can be selectively 
  // assigned to proper fields. (By default tailor will generate two themes: "light" and "dark")

  /// Let's say that my message bubble in 
  /// light mode is darkBlue
  /// dark mode is lightBlue
  @themeExtension
  static List<Bubble> myBubble = [Bubble.darkBlue, Bubble.lightBlue];

  /// Lets say that my message bubble in 
  /// light mode is darkOrange
  /// dark mode is lightOrange
  @themeExtension
  static List<Bubble> friendsBubble = [Bubble.darkOrange, Bubble.lightOrange];
}

@TailorComponent(themes: ['darkBlue', 'lightBlue', 'darkOrange', 'lightOrange'])
class _$Bubble {
  static List<Color> background = [/*Corresponding 'default' values for 'darkBlue', 'lightBlue', 'darkOrange', 'lightOrange'*/];
  static List<Color> textStyle = [/*Corresponding 'default' values for 'darkBlue', 'lightBlue', 'darkOrange', 'lightOrange'*/];
}

/// You can also nest classes marked with @tailor (not recommended)
@tailor
class _$MsgList {
  /// implementation
  /// foo
  /// bar 
  /// baz
}

class NotGeneratedExtension extends ThemeExtension<NotGeneratedExtension> {
  /// implementation
}
```

*Good and bad practices for modular or nested themes:*
```dart
/// Good:
@tailorComponent
class _$AppBarTheme {
  static List<Color> foreground = [Colors.white, Colors.white];
  static List<Color> background = [Colors.blue, Colors.black];
}

@tailor
class _$MyTheme {
  @themeExtension
  static List<AppBarTheme> appBarTheme = [AppBarTheme.light, AppBarTheme.dark];
}

/// Bad:
@tailor
class _$MyTheme {
  // This will not be animated and generated theme may result in List<dynamic> property instead of expected List<Color>
  static List<List<Color>> appBarTheme = [
    [Colors.white, Colors.blue],
    [Colors.white, Colors.black]
  ];
} 
```

To see an example implementation of a nested theme, head out to [example: nested_themes][example:nested_themes]

## Generate constant themes

If the following conditions are met, constant themes will be generated:

- All `List<T>` fields are `const`
- List length matches theme count
- List initializers are declared in place, for example:

```dart
const someOtherList = ['a','b'];

@Tailor(requireStaticConst: true)
class _$ConstantThemes {
  // This is correct
  static const someNumberList = [1, 2];
  
  // This is bad
  static const otherList = someOtherList;
}
```

It is possible to force generate constant themes using `Tailor(requireStaticConst: true)` annotation.
In this case fields that do not meet conditions will be excluded from the theme and a warning will be printed.

## Hot reload support
To enable hot reload support, use the `generateStaticGetters` property of the `@Tailor()` annotation. This will generate static getters that allow updating theme properties on hot reload. The getters will conditionally return either the theme itself (if kDebugMode == true) or the final theme otherwise.

To use hot reload with Tailor, make sure to follow these requirements:
- Import `package:flutter/foundation.dart` as the option depends on `kDebugMode` from this package
- Initialize your theme data in the build method
- Make sure that properties that should be hot reloadable are either getters or const

Here's an example usage:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

const lightColor = Color(0xFFA1B2C3);
const darkColor = Color(0xFF123ABC);

@tailor
class _$GetterTheme {
  // This is correct
  static const color1 = [lightColor, darkColor];
  static List<Color> get color2 => [lightColor, darkColor];

  // color3 won't be changed by hot reload as it is not a getter or const
  static List<Color> color3 = [lightColor, darkColor];
}

class GetterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const GetterPage({super.key});

  final _lightThemeData = ThemeData(extensions: [GetterTheme.light]);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final darkThemeData = ThemeData(extensions: [GetterTheme.dark]);

    return MaterialApp(
      // This is correct
      darkTheme: darkThemeData
      // This is correct
      //darkTheme: ThemeData(extensions: [GetterTheme.dark]),

      // This is incorrect for hot reload
      // It will not update as _lightThemeData won't be changed by hot reload
      // (It is necessary to create ThemeData in the build's scope - the same way as `darkThemeData`)
      theme: _lightThemeData,
    );
  }
}
```

## Custom types encoding
ThemeTailor will attempt to provide lerp method for types like:
- Color
- Color?
- TextStyle
- TextStyle?

In the case of an unrecognized or unsupported type, the generator provides a default lerping function (That does not interpolate values linearly but switches between them). 
You can specify a custom the lerp function for the given type (Color/TextStyle, etc.) or property by extending "ThemeEncoder" class from [theme_tailor_annotation]

Example of adding custom encoder for an int. 
###### my_theme.dart
```dart
import 'dart:ui';

class IntEncoder extends ThemeEncoder<int> {
  const IntEncoder();

  @override
  int lerp(int a, int b, double t) {
    return lerpDouble(a, b, t)!.toInt();
  }
}
```

Use it in different ways:

```dart
/// 1 Add it to the encoders list in the @Tailor() annotation
@Tailor(encoders: [IntEncoder()])
class _$Theme1 {}

/// 2 Add it as a separate annotation below @Tailor() or @tailor annotation
@tailor
@IntEncoder()
class _$Theme2 {}

/// 3 Add it below your custom tailor annotation
const appTailor = Tailor(themes: ['superLight']);

@appTailor
@IntEncoder()
class _$Theme3 {}

/// 4 Add it on the property
@tailor
class _$Theme4 {
    @IntEncoder()
    static const List<int> someValues = [1,2];
}

/// 5 IntEncoder() can be assigned to a variable and used as an annotation
/// It works for any of the previous examples
const intEncoder = IntEncoder();

@tailor
@intEncoder
class _$Theme5 {}
```

The generator chooses the proper lerp function for the given field based on the order:
- annotation on the field
- annotation on top of the class
- property from encoders list in the "@Tailor" annotation.

Custom-supplied encoders override default ones provided by the code generator. Unrecognized or unsupported types will use the default lerp function.

To see more examples of custom theme encoders implementation, head out to [example: theme encoders][example:theme_encoders]

## Flutter diagnosticable / debugFillProperties
To add support for Flutter diagnosticable to the generated ThemeExtension class, import Flutter foundation. Then create the ThemeTailor config class as usual.
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
```

To see an example of how to ensure debugFillProperties are generated, head out to [example: debugFillProperties][example:debug_fill_properties]

## Json serialization
The generator will copy all the annotations on the class and the static fields, including: "@JsonSerializable", "@JsonKey", custom JsonConverter(s), and generate the "fromJson" factory. If you wish to add support for the "toJson" method, you can add it in the class extension: 

```dart
@tailor
@JsonSerializable()
class _$SerializableTheme {

  /// This is a custom converter (it will be copied to the generated class)
  @JsonColorConverter()
  static List<Color> foo = [Colors.red, Colors.pink];
}

/// Extension for generated class to support toJson (JsonSerializable does not have to generate this method)
extension SerializableThemeExtension on SerializableTheme {
  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$SerializableThemeToJson(this);
}
```
To see an example implementation of "@JsonColorConverter" check out [example: json serializable][example:json_serializable]

To serialize nested themes, declare your config classes as presented in the [Nesting generated theme extensions, modular themes, design systems](#nesting-generated-themeextensions-modular-themes--designsystems). Make sure to use proper json_serializable config either in the annotation on the class or your config "build.yaml" or "pubspec.yaml". For more information about customizing build config for json_serializable head to the [json_serializable documentation][json_serializable_documentation].
```dart
@JsonSerializable(explicitToJson: true)
```

## Ignore fields
Fields other than `static List<T>` are ignored by default by the generator, but if you still want to ignore these, you can use `@ignore` annotation.
```dart
@tailor
class _$IgnoreExample {
  static List<Color> background = [AppColors.white, Colors.grey.shade900];
  @ignore
  static List<Color> iconColor = [AppColors.orange, AppColors.blue];
  @ignore
  static List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
}
```

## Build configuration
The generator will use properties from build.yaml or default values for null properties in the @Tailor annotation.

| Build option | Annotation property | Default | Info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| themes | themes | [light, dark] | <b>List<String></b> ([] empty array -> no themes generated) |
| theme_getter | themeGetter | on_build_context_props | <b>String</b> (ThemeGetter.name):<br><br>none \| on_theme_data \| on_theme_data_props \| on_build_context \| on_build_context_props |
| require_static_const | requireStaticConst | false | <b>bool</b> |

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      theme_tailor:
        options:
          themes: [light, dark, amoled]
          theme_getter: on_build_context_props
          require_static_const: false
```
